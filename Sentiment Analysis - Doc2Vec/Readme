This goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis using NLP and Doc2Vec and compare the results.

The NLP technique involves extracting important words and the feature vectors are inary vectors.
Doc2Vec is a technique where document vectors are learned using artificial neural networks. The vectors are formed in such a way that similar sentences have similar vector representations and the dimensionality of the vectors is significantly reduced compared to binary vectors.

The dataset used is the publicly available IMDB movie review and Twitter sentiment datasets.

Classifiers used for sentiment prediction are Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

More details about the methods and the functions can be found in the comments in sentiment.py
